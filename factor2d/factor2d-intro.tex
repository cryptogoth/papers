\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Shor's factoring algorithm is a central result in quantum computing, with an
exponential speed-up over the best-known classical algorithm \cite{Shor1994}.
As the most notable example of a quantum-classical complexity separation, much
effort has been devoted to implementations of factoring on a
realistic architectural model of a quantum computer
\cite{Beauregard2002,Kutin2006,VanMeter2006,VanMeter2005,VanMeterIL2005}.
We can bridge the gap between
the theoretical algorithm and a physical implementation by describing
the layout and interactions of qubits at an intermediate,
architectural level of abstraction.
This gives us a model for measuring circuit resources and their tradeoffs.
In this work, we present a novel quantum architecture for prime
integer factorization
in two dimensions that allows concurrent (parallel) two-qubit operations
between neighboring qubits.

Our paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:bg} introduces quantum architectural models, circuit
resources, and constant-depth communication techniques due to
\cite{Harrow2012,Rosenbaum2012}.
Section \ref{sec:related} places this work in the context of existing
results.
In Section \ref{sec:csa}, we provide a self-contained pedagogical review
of the carry-save technique and encoding.
In Section \ref{sec:csa-mod-add} we extend the carry-save technique to a 2D
modular adder,
which we then use as a basis for a modular multiplier
(Section \ref{sec:csa-mod-mult}) and a modular exponentiator
(Section \ref{sec:modexp}).
Finally, we analyze the asymptotic circuit resources required by our
approach and  compare them to previous implementations in the related work.
