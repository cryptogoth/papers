We present a 2D nearest-neighbor
quantum architecture for Shor's factoring algorithm in polylogarithmic
depth. Our implementation uses
%(1)
parallel phase estimation,
%(due to Kitaev, Shen, and Vyalyi),
%(2)
constant-depth fanout and teleportation,
%(due to Harrow, Fowler, and Taylor),
and
%(3)
constant-depth carry-save modular addition.
%(due to Gossett).
%We introduce a novel 2D architectural variation on Gossett's modular arithmetic
%and interleave constant-depth fanout and teleportation circuits for
%nearest-neighbor and long-distance communication channels, and ultimately use
%our circuit within parallel phase estimation to achieve quantum factoring.
We derive asymptotic bounds on the circuit depth and width of our architecture
and provide a comparison to all previous nearest-neighbor factoring
implementations.
