@article{Fowler2004,
abstract = {We present a method for constructing optimal fault-tolerant approximations of arbitrary unitary gates using an arbtrary discrete universal gate set. The method presented is numerical and scales exponentially with the number of gates used in the approximation, however, for the specific case of arbitrary single-qubit gates and the fault-tolerant gates permitted by the 7-qubit Steane code, it is shown that the longest practical gates sequences can be found. We also analyse the practicality of the fault-tolerant approximations of the phase rotation gates used in Shor's algorithm and find that simple non-fault-tolerant phase rotations are more robust for realistic error rates. A general scaling law of how rapidly these fault-tolerant approximations converge to arbitrary single-qubit gates is also determined.},

abstract = {This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in the form of an efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary single-qubit gate into a sequence of gates from a fixed and finite set. The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of \$\backslash pi / 2\^{}k\$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-\{$\backslash$sc not\}, and \$\backslash pi / 8\$ gates. The algorithm runs in \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{2.71\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ time, and produces as output a sequence of \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{3.97\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from \$SU(d)\$.},

abstract = {We present an efficient addition circuit, borrowing techniques from the classical carry-lookahead arithmetic circuit. Our quantum carry-lookahead (QCLA) adder accepts two n-bit numbers and adds them in O(log n) depth using O(n) ancillary qubits. We present both in-place and out-of-place versions, as well as versions that add modulo 2\^{}n and modulo 2\^{}n - 1.   Previously, the linear-depth ripple-carry addition circuit has been the method of choice. Our work reduces the cost of addition dramatically with only a slight increase in the number of required qubits. The QCLA adder can be used within current modular multiplication circuits to reduce substantially the run-time of Shor's algorithm.},

@article{Burrello2010,
abstract = {We describe the hashing technique to obtain a fast approximation of a target quantum gate in the unitary group SU(2) represented by a product of the elements of a universal basis. The hashing exploits the structure of the icosahedral group [or other finite subgroups of SU(2)] and its pseudogroup approximations to reduce the search within a small number of elements. One of the main advantages of the pseudogroup hashing is the possibility to iterate to obtain more accurate representations of the targets in the spirit of the renormalization group approach. We describe the iterative pseudogroup hashing algorithm using the universal basis given by the braidings of Fibonacci anyons. The analysis of the efficiency of the iterations based on the random matrix theory indicates that the runtime and the braid length scale poly-logarithmically with the final error, comparing favorably to the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm.},

It has been shown that this is possible for almost all choices of base sets and furthermore that the number of gates required for precision epsilon is only polynomial in log 1/epsilon. Here we prove that using certain sets of base gates quantum compiling requires a string length that is linear in log 1/epsilon, a result which matches the lower bound from counting volume up to constant factor.},

@article{Bremner2002,
abstract = {Which gates are universal for quantum computation? Although it is well known that certain gates on two-level quantum systems (qubits), such as the controlled-not (CNOT), are universal when assisted by arbitrary one-qubit gates, it has only recently become clear precisely what class of two-qubit gates is universal in this sense. Here we present an elementary proof that any entangling two-qubit gate is universal for quantum computation, when assisted by one-qubit gates. A proof of this important result for systems of arbitrary finite dimension has been provided by J. L. and R. Brylinski [arXiv:quant-ph/0108062, 2001]; however, their proof relies upon a long argument using advanced mathematics. In contrast, our proof provides a simple constructive procedure which is close to optimal and experimentally practical [C. M. Dawson and A. Gilchrist, online implementation of the procedure described herein (2002), http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/gqc/].},

@article{Cleve2000,
abstract = {We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2\^{}n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)\^{}2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2\^{}n, for which the best previous bound was O(n\^{}2).   As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP\^{}BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.   Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).},
